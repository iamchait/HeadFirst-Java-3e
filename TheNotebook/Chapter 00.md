# üìò The Introduction

This vault is designed to work alongside an IntelliJ project and is also included in the Git repository associated with that project to track my Java learning progress. The name of the repository is **`HeadFirst-Java-3e`**. Inside the repository, there is a dedicated directory named **`TheNotebook`**, which integrates this vault for better organization and version control.

## üóÇÔ∏è Organization

 Currently, the vault contains only one directory ‚Äî the home directory named **`TheNotebook`**. As my learning journey progresses, this vault will continue to evolve to improve organization and clarity.
> The files in this vault are organized by chapter and contain my personal notes based on each chapter from the book **_Head First Java, 3rd Edition_** by Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates, and Trisha Gee (published by O'Reilly).

## üéØ Goal

My goal on this journey is to build a strong and repeatable habit of **learning**, **recording**, **practicing**, **revising**, and **reinforcing**‚Äîuntil I master the Java programming language for back-end development.

This vault will serve as my second brain, tracking not only what I‚Äôve learned, but also **how** I‚Äôve learned it. I‚Äôll evolve this system as I grow more experienced.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies in Scope

The following tools and technologies are central to my learning plan. Each plays a distinct role in becoming a proficient back-end developer:

| Tool             | Use Case                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Java**    | Foundation of all Java development‚Äîsyntax, OOP, collections, exceptions, etc. |
| **UML**          | Unified Modeling Language for Designing and Planning Classes.                 |
| **SQL**          | Managing and querying relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).         |
| **Git & GitHub** | Version control and collaboration; tracking progress over time.               |
| **Maven**        | Dependency management and project build automation.                           |
| **Spring Boot**  | Building production-ready, standalone web applications with Java.             |
| **Kafka**        | Distributed event streaming for real-time data pipelines and microservices.   |
| **Hibernate**    | Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to manage database access in Java.            |
| **AWS**          | Cloud deployment and infrastructure (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.) for scalable apps.   |
